Diabetes is caused due to the excessive amount of sugar condensed into the blood. Currently, it is considered as one of the lethal diseases in the world. People all around the globe are affected by this severe disease knowingly or unknowingly. Diabetes is seen in all age groups these days and they are attributed to lifestyle, genetic, stress and age factor. Previously they used different types of machine learning algorithm like KNN, SVM, Naive Bayes, Random forest, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting .So, we are using Logistic Regression. Logistic regression is easier to implement, interpret, and very efficient to train.It makes no assumptions about distributions of classes in feature space. This project will make predictions whether the person having diabetic or not.
